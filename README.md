# DuckHunt-Game
This project is made by JavaFx.
This is my first game project in my first year at the Hacettepe University Computer Science department.
It may sound familiar to you as an Atari game at the beginning of the 21st century.

You can start the game by using this command:
first comply: javac DuckHunt.java
then start the game: java DuckHunt
